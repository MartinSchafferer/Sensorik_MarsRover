These durable (but affordable!) plastic gearbox motors (also known as 'TT' motors) are an easy, low-cost way to get your projects moving. This is a TT DC Gearbox Motor with a gear ratio of 1:48, and it comes with 2 x 200mm wires with breadboard-friendly 0.1" male connectors. Perfect for plugging into a breadboard or terminal blocks.

You can power these motors with 3VDC up to 6VDC, they'll of course go a little faster at the higher voltages. We grabbed one motor and found these stats when running it from a bench-top supply

    At 3VDC we measured 150mA @ 120 RPM no-load, and 1.1 Amps when stalled
    At 4.5VDC we measured 155mA @ 185 RPM no-load, and 1.2 Amps when stalled
    At 6VDC we measured 160mA @ 250 RPM no-load, and 1.5 Amps when stalled

Note that these are very basic motors, and have no built-in encoders, speed control or positional feedback. Voltage goes in, rotation goes out! There will be variation from motor to motor, so a separate feedback system is required if you need precision movement.
